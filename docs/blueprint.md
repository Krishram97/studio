## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FF9933), inspired by Indian culture, to represent energy and growth. This saturated hue provides good contrast against a dark or light background.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated tint of saffron, provides a neutral backdrop that highlights the primary color while maintaining a connection to Indian aesthetics. Suitable for a light scheme.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), an analogous color that adds a touch of modernity and technological sophistication, differentiating CTAs and highlights. Much darker and more saturated than the primary.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to convey a tech-forward feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a modern, neutral aesthetic.
- Use clean and modern icons with a subtle Indian design influence (e.g., هندسة معمارية, colors) to represent various services and features.
- Maintain a clean, modern, and fully responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experience across all devices, with a culturally relevant touch.
- Incorporate subtle animations, especially on the roadmap and radar demos, to engage users and enhance the storytelling aspect of the site.
